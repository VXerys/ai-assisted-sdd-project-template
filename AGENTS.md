# Repository contract: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

Rendered from `docs/steering/` and `sdd.config.json` for humans and coding agents. Edit the steering files, then run `npm run adapters:sync`.

## Read first

1. `docs/context/BRIEF.md` (single entry point; rendered, never hand-edited)
2. The Rules and Tech sections below; the other steering files in the table reach each tool through its rule files, otherwise read one before work on its topic
3. The active feature under `docs/specs/`: `tasks.md`, then the sections it references

Fallback when `BRIEF.md` is absent: `docs/context/NEW_CHAT_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Source of truth

## Read-only paths

Generated (edit the sources, then run `npm run context:render` or `npm run adapters:sync`): `docs/context/state.yaml`, `docs/context/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `docs/context/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/context/BRIEF.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/`, `.kiro/steering/`

Frozen (explicit owner approval required): none

## Rules

Engineering rules every agent and contributor applies. The principles behind them are in the project constitution; the lifecycle is in `workflow.md`.

### Engineering

- Follow existing project patterns before introducing a new abstraction.
- Keep the change inside the selected task. Discovered work becomes a new task in `tasks.md`, not a silent extension.
- Inspect the repository before asserting a path, API, schema field, command, or framework behavior. Never invent one.
- Preserve existing behavior and contracts unless the referenced spec changes them.
- Add or update tests for changed behavior. Never weaken or disable a test to make a check pass.
- Comments explain why, not what. No decorative banners or separator comments.
- Treat generated and frozen paths from `sdd.config.json` as read-only.

### Evidence before claims

- "Done" means: analyze, typecheck, test, and build commands from `tech.md` ran, and their output is recorded as EV blocks in the feature's `verification.md`.
- A check that could not run is reported with the reason and residual risk. It is never reported as passed.
- A task reaches `done` only with at least one evidence id. A feature reaches `implemented` only with every task `done` or `deferred` and no `open` assumption.

### Unknowns

Log an unknown in `docs/context/ASSUMPTIONS.md` as `A-XXX` with `status: open` instead of guessing. Continue only on work the assumption does not affect; mark the affected task `blocked`.

### Prohibited without explicit owner approval

- Changing a public API, event, or data contract.
- Destructive data operations: drop, mass delete, reset, backfill with unknown impact, editing an applied migration.
- Replacing a major framework, provider, or dependency; adding a dependency outside the policy in `tech.md`.
- Breaking an architecture boundary or dependency direction.
- Changing production infrastructure, credentials, or configuration.
- Bypassing authentication or authorization.
- Force push, history rewrite, or any git operation that can destroy work.
- Editing a generated or frozen path.
- Publishing, deploying, or sending messages on the owner's behalf.

### Stop conditions

Stop and report, instead of implementing, when the task would require any prohibited action above, when two sources of truth conflict, when a blocking assumption is open, or when a required command is unavailable.

### Data and security

- No secrets in the repository. Never read, print, or commit `.env*`, key files, keystores, or store credentials.
- Authorization is enforced at a trusted boundary; hiding UI is not authorization.
- Validate untrusted input at the boundary. Do not log secrets, tokens, auth headers, or unnecessary personal data.
- Data store changes are versioned, append-only, reviewed, and reversible or explicitly accepted as forward-only.
- Project-specific rule: {{DATA_RULE_OR_NONE}}

### Source of truth and conflicts

Requirements own behavior, system architecture owns module decisions, design owns the repository mapping, `tasks.md` owns task status, code and tests own current behavior, `tech.md` owns commands. Chat history and provider memory are never a source of truth.

When sources conflict: stop the affected work, name both sources, inspect code and git, propose the smallest correction, get approval for product, architecture, security, or data changes, update the canonical source, then continue.

## Tech

Stack and commands. `npm run init` fills every `PRESET_` placeholder from the chosen app and database presets (`scripts/init/presets/`); everything else is filled from the real repository. A command listed here must exist and run.

### Stack

| Concern | Technology | Reason or constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Language and runtime | {{PRESET_LANGUAGE}} | |
| Application framework | {{PRESET_APP}} | |
| Data store | {{PRESET_DB}} | relational, document, key-value, embedded local, file, or none |
| Source and test paths | {{PRESET_FILE_MATCH}} | globs used by `fileMatch` steering rules |

Add rows for the backend or API, auth, state management, build tooling, test framework, and deployment target once they are decided. A row that does not apply says `none`, not an invented value. Mobile (Flutter, Kotlin, React Native) and non-relational stores are first-class here.

### Commands

Run these before claiming any task done. Report a command that cannot run; never claim its success. `none` means the preset has no command for that purpose; replace it when the project gains one.

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `{{PRESET_INSTALL}}` |
| Analyze or lint | `{{PRESET_LINT}}` |
| Typecheck | `{{PRESET_TYPECHECK}}` |
| Format check | `{{PRESET_FORMAT}}` |
| Test | `{{PRESET_TEST}}` |
| Build | `{{PRESET_BUILD}}` |
| Run locally | `{{PRESET_DEV}}` |
| Data store change check | `{{PRESET_DB_MIGRATION_COMMAND}}` |
| Context validation | `npm run context:validate` |

### Stack rules

- {{PRESET_APP_NOTES}}

### Environment and secrets

- Secrets come from the environment or a secret manager; `.env*`, key files, and store credentials are never read, printed, or committed by an agent.
- Example-config files (`.env.example` or equivalent) document required variables without values.

### Dependency policy

Before adding or replacing a dependency, state the problem it solves, the native alternative considered, maintenance health, runtime or bundle impact, and license. Approval rule: the owner approves every new or replaced dependency; record the approval in the task that adds it.

### Data store changes

Schema, rules, index, or migration changes are versioned files in the repository, reviewed like code. Append-only; destructive changes need explicit approval. The store's own rules are in the `database.md` steering file when a database preset was chosen. The full procedure is `docs/runbooks/database-migrations.md` (full tier).

## Commands

Project commands: the Commands table in `docs/steering/tech.md` (the Tech section above). Context: `npm run context:render`, then `npm run context:validate`. Adapters: `npm run adapters:sync`.

Without hooks (multi-repository cloud sessions, project threads, tools without hooks): run `npm run sdd -- brief` first, and `npm run sdd -- guard --check` and `npm run sdd -- validate` before claiming done.
